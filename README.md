This project is a java related project.in this project we have designed how a vending machine can be programmed.And this  vending machine program is programmed to be user friendly.with this program the user can choose what soft drink they want .The program is programmed to display the price list of the soft drink of there choice.This program is programmed like how a vending machine only dispenses four drinks at a time.Then we use looping to determine whether the user wants to continue or exit.if the user want to continue the program starts again from the beginning with what soft drink you want to buy?.Otherwise the program will come out and display the total cost of soft drinks purchased by the user.The program is programmed as is the user pays for it.If the user pays the appropriate amount ,it will say "Take your drinks","Have a nice day".May be if user pays more the program way that the total amount is subtracted by the user wallet amount .the program will return the balance amount to the user  If the amount paid by user is below the appropriate amount. The program will display"not enough to pay "and the program will go to the payments enter section.If the user clicks anything wrong the specified values of soft drinks name ,price list and quantity.the program  will display the another matching response.   
In java we use a class called Scanner to receive input from the user.To use that class we need to import this package in java.
